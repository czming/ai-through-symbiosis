This is the README from the template GT2k project directory,
gt2k/template. It is copied by the gt2k/utils/new_project.sh script
when creating a new GT2K project. DO NOT MODIFY THE gt2k/template
DIRECTORY (unless you want the changes to propagate to all future
projects).

The template directory provides general setup common to all GT2K
projects.  However, there are some project specific aspects that the
user must specify:
 
1) 	The location and hierarchy of the data to recognize.

2) 	Methods for annotating (labeling) the data.

3) 	The HMM topologies/parameters used to model the data.

4) 	A list of the gestures to recognize (often referred to as the
	commands, tokens, or  vocabulary). 

5) 	A grammar specifying a semantic interpretation of the data.

Please see the tutorial projects in the gt2k/tutorials directory for
guidance and hints on how to create (and tailor) this information to
suit your project.
