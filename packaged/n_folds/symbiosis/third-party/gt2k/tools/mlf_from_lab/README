============================================================================

This is a quick little tool that takes a list of label files as input and
consolidates them all to one MLF file to keep things tidy.  This is really only
useful to you if you have data that has already been labeled in individual lab
files for HTK by some other tool.

============================================================================

usage: make_mlf_from_lab
note:
looks for "labfiles" which contains a list of lab files to process

============================================================================

This directory is set up so that you can do an example run.  There are lab
files: 1.lab  up_3.lab  up_4.lab  up_5.lab  up_6.lab  up_7.lab  up_8.lab
up_9.lab.  The "labfiles" file contains a list of these files.  After running
"make_mlf_from_labfiles" there will be an output file "labels.mlf" which will
be a MLF file containing the information from all the label files it has
processed.
