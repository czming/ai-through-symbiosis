## Purpose: Display a graphical representaion of an HTK HMM definition file.
##
## Input  : param1 --> name of the HMM definition file to vizualize
##
##
## NOTES  : Several executables are required:
##
##    dot   ( a component of GraphViz )
##    gv    ( a PostScript viewer     )
##    htk2dot ( included executable     )
##  
##
## BUGS    : Currently this script can only handle one file at a time 
##         it cannot take in multiple files and generate the
##       the postscript for them all.

Files
~~~~~~

  This distribution should contain:

  htk2dot.c --> src for htk to dot translator
  htk2dot.h --> src for htk to dot translator
  Makefile  --> makefile to build htk2dot executable
  hv.sh     --> script to automate the visualization process
  README    --> this file


Purpose
~~~~~~~
HTK HMM definition to GraphViz DOT vizualization tool.
This program assumes a well formed definition file.  Its intent is to 
graphically visualize the text definition file so that the user can ensure a 
correct topology of the defined hmm.


Setup
~~~~~
before executing the script be sure that "make" is typed in the directory
containing the source to build htk2dot.  Make sure this file is in the same
directory containing the script as the script will not work without it.


Usage
~~~~~
to visualize HMM definition file <hmmfile> simple execute the script

  ./hv.sh <hmmfile>
