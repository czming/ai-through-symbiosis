     GT2k Quick Start Guide
##################################################

After installing HTK and GT2k (see the INSTALL file), you will want
to use the utils/new_project.sh file to start a new project.

You'll need to know three things:
1) where you want your new project to go
2) the size of your data vector
3) where you installed GT2k

For instance, if you wanted to start a new project ~/my_gt2k_proj,
which used data consisting of 24 inputs (the number of feature vector
elements), and you installed gt2k to /usr/local/gt2k, you would run:


     /usr/local/gt2k/utils/new_project.sh ~/my_gt2k_proj 24 /usr/local/gt2k


This will create your new project, creating a directory, copying over
general files and directories. Some subdirectories in the project
directory are empty. These directories will be populated with project
specific files generated by GT2K during the data preparation and model
training processes. Each project directory contains a copy of the
template directory README file. This will provide some guidance on how
to adapt the general project directory to the specifics of your
project.


The file describing the specifics of your project is:

     ~/my_gt2k_proj/scripts/options.sh, 


While most of the default values will suffice, some of the values need
to be edited to reflect the specifics of your project. To better
understand how to do this, we have provided example projects and
tutorials.


We have provided two example projects and associated tutorial on how
the example projects were generated. Example projects can be found in:

     /usr/local/gt2k/examples

Their counterpart tutorials are located in:

     /usr/local/gt2k/tutorials

The tutorials provide walk--throughs on how the example projects were
generated. We encourage using this tutorial (and comparing to the
example projects) before attempting to use GT2K.


Thanks for using the Georgia Tech Gesture Toolkit!
