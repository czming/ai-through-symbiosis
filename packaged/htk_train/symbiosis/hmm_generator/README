gen_hmmdef.pl : for generating HMM definitions

============================================================================

GEN_HMMDEF.PL

Usage: ./gen_hmmdef.pl -n num_states -v vector_size -s skip [-d] [output file]
  -n num_states   The number of states for the HMM to have
  -v vector_size  The size of the feature vector
  -s skip         The number of skip states in the HMM
  -d              Use a diagonal covariance matrix instead of a full matrix

Note: Be sure to add 2 to your desired number of states - one for NULL
begin state and one for NULL end state.
