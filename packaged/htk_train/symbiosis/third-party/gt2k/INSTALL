Installing the Georgia Tech Gesture Toolkit

First, you will need to get the Hidden Markov Model Toolkit (HTK) from its
website at

http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/

You will need version 3.2.  If you like, you can configure and install it
yourself, or you can allow our installer to try and install it for you.

------------------------------------------
Configuring the installer:

After downloading HTK-3.2.tar.gz, configure the Makefile in the main
gt2k directory:

Makefile options:
# install HTK (1) or don't (0)
INSTALL_HTK=1

Set this to 1 if you wish us to install HTK, 0 if you wish to do it yourself.

# Location of the HTK source, needed only if you wish us to install HTK
HTK_LOC=./HTK-3.2.tar.gz

# where the HTK binaries will go, needed only if you wish us to install HTK
HTK_DEST=/usr/local/bin 

# where the gt2k scripts and examples will go
GT2K_DEST=/usr/local/gt2k

In the case of both the HTK_DEST and the GT2K_DEST, you must have write
permissions for the directories in order for the install to succeed.

If you need root permissions, then please run the install process as root.

------------------------------------------
Compiling GT2k (And HTK, if specified)

If you are installing HTK with this installer, be sure you have write
permissions for the HTK destination directory.

Run the following:

	make

This will (if you specified) compile and install HTK, afterwards compiling
the utilities in the gt2k/utils directory
-------------------------------------------
Installation:

Make sure you have permissions for the GT2k destination directory, then run:

	make install

This will copy the contents of the utils, tools, tutorials, and examples
directories to the destination specified in the Makefile.
